# Abstract
The 2017-2027 Decadal Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space (ESAS 2017) was released in January 2018. ESAS 2017 was driven by input from the scientific community and policy experts and provides a strategic vision for the next decade of Earth observation that informs federal agencies responsible for the planning and execution of civilian space-based Earth-system programs in the coming decade. These include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). NASA has, thus far, utilized this document as a guide to inform exploration of new Earth mission concepts that are later considered as can-didates for fully funded missions. High-priority emphasis areas and targeted observables include global-scale Earth science questions related to hydrology, ecosystems, weather, climate, and solid earth. One of the Designated Observables (DO’s) identified by ESAS 2017 was Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) with a goal to acquire concurrent global hyperspectral visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR; 380–2500 nm) and multispectral midwave and thermal infrared (MWIR: 3–5 μm; TIR: 8–12 μm) image data at high spatial resolution (~30 m in the VSWIR and ~ 60 m in the TIR) at sub-monthly temporal resolution globally. The final sensor characteristics will be determined during the mission formulation phase, but ESAS 2017 provides guidance for a VSWIR instrument with 30–45 m pixel resolution, ≤16 day global revisit, SNR > 400 in the VNIR, SNR > 250 in the SWIR, and 10 nm sampling in the range 380–2500 nm. It also recommends a TIR instrument with more than five channels in 8–12 μm, and at least one channel at 4 μm, ≤60 m pixel resolution, ≤3 day global revisit, and noise equivalent delta temperature (NEdT) ≤0.2 K (NASEM, 2018; Schimel et al., 2020). Alone, SBG will provide a comprehensive global monitoring for multiple scientific disciplines. Complemented with systems like Landsat and Sentinel-2 VSWIR, global change processes with faster than 16-day global change rates can be mapped. Further, complimented with planned TIR systems such as LSTM and TRISHNA, the temporal revisit could be as frequent as 1-day at the equator, making the system excellent for tracking dynamic thermal features and hazards. This document will grow to fully describe the planned Level-3 Surface Mineralogy (SM) product for the SBG TIR data.
